        Ultra endurance sports are the biggest part of my identity. 
        It's my way of stepping as far outside my comfort zone as possible. 
        It's how I teach myself to believe in myself no matter what. 
        I've been a runner for most my life but I've recently gotten into road cycling too.

        "What's wrong with you? Why would you do that to yourself?"
        I hear this kind of stuff all the time when I talk about my training or races. 
        I struggled a lot with self esteem when I was younger. 
        It held me back in everything I did.

        I have a philosophy that the biggest limits are the ones we put on ourselves. 
        It's very obvious to me now that my own self doubt was by far my biggest problem. 
        I don't believe we gain confidence through self love tactics, 
        we earn confidence by getting out of our comfort zone.

        I'm also a huge chess nerd. I used to play competitively when I was younger, and I still follow top level events. 
        I'm a decent home cook as well, I love trying new recipes and experimenting with different styles and cooking methods.
        Okay, maybe the decent part is a bit of a stretch.
