        I'm not driven by money, I'm driven by impact. It's clear to me that too many technologies are designed purely for profit.
        They often neglect real issues, or worse, they fuel problems like addiction, social isolation, and undermine our values. 
        My goal is work with like minded individuals to create software that is ethical, sustainable, and beneficial.

        I'm drawn to programming because of the problem solving aspect. 
        I'm always looking for a tough challenge, it could be optimizing a data pipeline, scaling a service, or creating a fancy animation for a website.
        I take pride in my work and willingness to take on difficult tasks.

       Right now I mostly do web stuff inside and outside my job. 
       I use both client side and server side technologies, and sometimes more broad engineering concepts.
       I am trying to get into data science, specfically data engineering and ETL pipelines.
