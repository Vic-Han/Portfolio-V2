        Ultra endurance sports are the biggest part of my identity. 
        It's my way of stepping as far outside my comfort zone as possible. 
        It's how I teach myself to believe in myself no matter what. 
        I've been a runner for most my life but I've recently gotten into raod cycling too.

        Why? What's wrong with you? Why would you do that to yourself? 
        I hear this kind of stuff all the time when I talk about my training or races. 
        I struggled a lot with self esteem and trauma when I was younger. 
        It held me back in almost everything I did.

        I have a philosophy that the biggest limits are the ones we put on ourselves. 
        I realize now that I could have done so much more if I believed in myself just a little bit more. 
        And I don't believe we gain confidence by complimenting a mirror or through obsecure self love tactics.
        We earn confidence by getting out of our comfort zone.
