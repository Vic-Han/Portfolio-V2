        Ultra endurance sports are the biggest part of my identity. 
        It's my way of stepping as far outside my comfort zone as possible. 
        It's how I teach myself to believe in myself no matter what. 
        I've been a runner for most my life but I've recently gotten into road cycling too.

        What's wrong with you? Why would you do that to yourself? 
        I hear this kind of stuff all the time when I talk about my training or races. 
        I struggled a lot with self esteem and trauma when I was younger. 
        It held me back in everything I did.

        I have a philosophy that the biggest limits are the ones we put on ourselves. 
        It's very obvious to me now that my own self doubt was dragging me down, and I see all the time in others too. 
        I don't believe we gain confidence through self love tactics, 
        we earn confidence by getting out of our comfort zone.

        Ultra endurance events are designed to break you down to nothing. 
        There is a certain type of confidence that can only come from finding more when you thought you had nothing left. 
        To me, it was never about the numbers or achievement, it's about the growth that comes from it.

        I want to tackle races like the Artic Ultra and Badwater in the far(?) future.
        I also enjoy trying to craft recipes in the kitchen, but whether I'm actually good at it is up for debate.
        I love karoake too, but it's not up for debate that I'm horrendous at it.
