        I'm not driven by money, I'm driven by impact. It's clear to me that too many technologies and innovations are designed purely for profit.
        They often neglect real world problems, or worse, they create problems, like addiction. 
        But this doesn't mean that technology can't make a positive impact, I see many innovations that do so. 
        I firmly believe in using technology for the greater good. My goal is to leave a positive mark on this planet.

        What do I enjoy about programming? I'm interested in ...anything challenging really. 
        It could be trying to implement a scalable solution, optimize a data pipline, or even make some fancy animations for a website. 
        The type of stuff that makes your brain twist, if you know what I mean. 
        I take pride in my work and willingness to take on difficult tasks.
